    "text": "AI and Learning\nI have a lot of thoughts about this.1\nArtificial intelligence – in particular, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT – are incredibly useful tools. To get the mundane observation out of the way: they are very likely to radically change the way we all work over the next several years, just like a variety of other technologies before them (see: the internet, the personal computer, electricity, the steam engine, the printing press, the wheel, control fire, etc.) AI already has a ton of valuable use cases, including in education, data analysis, and research, and the possibilites are only growing.2\nHowever, to make most effective use of AI, it’s also important to understand exactly what AI is. Current AI models are what is known as Large Langauge Models, or LLMs. An LLM, at its core, is a probabilistic model whose primary function is to produce the next token – usually a word – that is most likely to make sense, based upon some prompt. It does not care if this token represents truth, reality, or a functional line of code – it only cares if the next token seems to make sense. Frequently, what it produces will incidentally be true, functional code, or an accurate representation of the world. That is what makes it useful! Frequently, it will also produce nonsense (or what we formally know as a “hallucination”). LLMs have advised people to eat rocks, hold cheese on pizza with glue, failed to perform simple arithmetic with decimals, and made up wholly invented bibliographic references, statistical libraries, and analysis results.\nFurthermore, this incidental relationship to the real world is by design – it is inherent to the way LLMs work. They don’t verify what they say with base reality, they just spit out what sounds good to probabilistic algorithms.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Very Academic Note\n\n\n\nLLMs are, in a formal sense, bullshit of the first order. And yes: “bullshit” here is a technical academic term, meaning “language produced without regard for truth.”4\n“The problem here isn’t that large language models hallucinate, lie, or misrepresent the world in some way. It’s that they are not designed to represent the world at all; instead, they are designed to convey convincing lines of text.” (Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, 2024)\nAnd yes, for those interested, the fact that this is from an academic research paper is what makes your normally proper and profanity-averse professor feel somewhat gleefully authorized to use the term “bullshit” in a syllabus.5 There is a more diplomatic and professional seeming word that some use for the profusion of misguided output of AI: slop, which most use to mean the profusion and explosion of low-quality AI material. In short, they mean a profusion of what Frankfurt so artfully frames as bullshit. But with such a pithy and expressive alternative available to us in the English language, why rely on “slop”?\n\n\nThis incidental relationship LLMs have with truth is also what makes relying on an LLM dangerous. You can’t reliably evaluate LLM outputs until you already know enough about a subject to judge good use of language from bad use of language. However, in the very beginning phases of learning how to write code, conduct data analysis, and discuss it, the problem is that you don’t yet know enough about the subject to reliably evaluate the quality of AI outputs.\nFurthermore, and even more problematically, using them early can hamper your ability to understand the fundamental conceptual elements of programming and statistics, concepts which, when will understood, will eventually enable your most effecive use of this new class of tools. Accordingly, I strongly encourage you to avoid using generative-AI tools in this course, except if (and where) encouraged by me. Even if it gives you an immediate shortcut, it is likely put you at a long-term disadvantage, even using AI, when compared to students that learned the old school way.6"

    "section": "Using AI Responsibly",
    "text": "Using AI Responsibly\nSo why am I waxing rhapsodic about the dangers of AI use? Is this simply a case of old man yells at cloud? Well, possibly.7 But not really. As we move forward with social life where everyone’s work is in collaboration with, or enhanced by, the use of varying kinds of technology and AI, one of the most critical elements for us to work on is not just how to use AI, but how to use AI responsibly, in a way that furthers our goals as policy analysts, academics, administrators, and communicators.\nNow, this is not a class on how to use AI, nor on the ethical and responsible use of AI. (It’s a class on statistics.) But that doesn’t mean ethical and responsible use of AI is not important. There is little in ethics that is purely black and white, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t some very clear guidelines one should use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsible AI\n\n\n\nWhenever you use AI tools for a project you attach your name to, you are still taking implicit responsiblity for that project, product, or document. This means that it is incumbent upon you to to the followup work necessary to validate, verify, and confirm that the language and work produced by the machine that works without regard for truth is accurate and functional. AI is not a coauthor,8 and I promise you that OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral, etc won’t take responsibility for whatever you produce with their tools - that’s on you.9\nJust like any other tool or source you use, all use of AI, in anything you turn in for this class, should be documented and identified in your work. If you used AI to help you write code, note you used AI to help you write code. If you use it to help you write analysis, not how you used it to help you write analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective AI use in Learning\n\n\n\nAny use of AI in learning environments should enhance, not take the place of, learning fundamental core concepts. Your goal in the class is to learn things important for your future career or for your general edification as a human and scholar; my goal is to do my level best to help you - not a machine - learn these things.\nIn other, more pithy words: don’t outsource the important process of your own learning critical thinking to the philosophical bullshit machine.10\n\n\nPhilosophical musings, however, can be difficult to wrap around practical usage. So, in case it is helpful, and in the interest of full disclosure, here are some of the ways that I use AI in my own work, along with some notes about the pitfalls and things I am careful about:\n\nI look up function calls or code syntax in programming languages I already understand well, and sometimes ask LLMs to write small code snippets for me. This is one of my more common use cases for AI professionally, and one that noticeably speeds things up for me - I can typically at a glance tell if some code I’m given is wonky, and can always validate and verify that the output of the code is what I expect. Note that I do not ask LLMs to write large chunk of code or whole programs for me, which would be more difficult for me to verify in a way that would leave me comfortable taking responsibility for the code.\nI regularly use AI to help me translate between different formats, programming languages, or coding schemes. Much of this syllabus, for instance, was first written in LaTex, and later translated, with the help of ChatGPT, to quarto.\nI occasionally use agentic LLMs to try to find new literature on a topic. This is a fraught process, as LLMs will frequently make citations up, but it is still sometimes useful. The fact that I have to verify every citation makes this not terribly useful, though.\nI typically use AI in ways that induces extra friction between the AI generating process and my own work, which forces me to review it before inserting it into my document or code. Typically, this means I ask ChatGPT or Claude for things directly in the chatbot interface, and don’t go much into using tools that interface directly with my documetns or scripts (like Microsoft/Github Copilot).\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that my way is the only ethical way to use AI. I think many people use Github Copilot in responsible ways, for instance. But it is the way that I have found it most useful to use ChatGPT\nNote a common feature here: LLMs are things I use as tools to enhance my own productivity, not as minds to replace my own.11 Despite the hype and publicity of certain AI companies and their founders, there are a number of good reasons to doubt that LLMs are anywhere near human level intelligence (or AGI, as many like to refer to it). There are even lots of good reasons to believe the entire concept of “reaching human intelligence” (again, AGI), is fundamentally flawed - beliefs held by a number of cognitive scientists, psychologists, computer scientists, and philosophers with far more expertise in minds, brains, logic, and programming than you or me.\nAnother way to think of it: Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, had a favorite metahpor he liked to use when selling the virtues of computers: a computer, he claimed, is a bicycle for the mind. The advent of technical progress means that your ChatGPT-equipped Apple laptop may be more like an automobile for your mind, rather than a bicycle, but the parallel is still apt: neither the bicyle nor the automobile replaces your own mind; it merely augments it."

    "section": "Bringing it Back Around: AI in Class",
    "text": "Bringing it Back Around: AI in Class\nI am neither an AI skeptic nor an AI propagandizer. AI, I think – and LLMs in particular, as the current dominant instantiation of AI – is just the next technological jump forward. Whether it turns into a giant leap or a fumbling stumble, I think, is yet to be seen.12\nThat said, I also believe that, even in courses that are not directly about AI, one of my jobs as an educator is to help all of my students learn how to use AI effectively. I don’t ban the use of AI in my class – except in ways that violate common decency, the law, or other educational or professional obligations – and even tacitly encourage in some circumstances.\nI would also strongly encourage you to be skeptical about overusing AI as you learn. I would also encourage you to not make the mistake of confusing assessement with learning.13 Assessment is an obligation of your professor to measure out how well you know class material, but assessment is not the end goal of education any more than taking your blood pressure is the end goal of going to a physician’s office. The goal of education is learning. Don’t mistake the means for the end: I don’t care about assessing what ChatGPT “thinks” about something any more than your physician cares about what ChatGPT’s blood pressure is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor Uses of AI\n\n\n\nAs an aside, poor uses of AI are often easily detectable to the eye of your professor. Good, and effective, AI usage often has the property of being largely undetectable, even to a trained eye – that’s what makes it effective use of the tool, actually! But bad usage is often so obvious as to be painful. Some examples:\n\nStudents who turn in papers and problem sets that reference methodological tools or techniques way beyond the understanding of the material they show in person or in in-class tests and assignments. (I’ve seen many students propose using methods that would only come to them in their third or fourth semester of statistics in an introductory research methods class, for instance.)\nStudents who authoritatively reference scholars who don’t exist, or authoritatively reference scholars that exist but articles or books that those scholars never wrote.\nStudents who turn in assignments that match the style of documents that are well represented in the training set of an LLM (like a five paragraph essay, for instance) but do so for an assignment where the directions were clearly for something else (like, say, a Socratic dialogue.)\n\nIf you do such things in your work, you will find me take points off not necessarily because you used AI - which is typically allowed - but because you’ve made a poor use of AI, and the work doesn’t meet the standards of the class.\n\n\nFinally, my job, goal, and interest in this class is to help you, my human student, learn how to valuable things like write code; wrangle and visualize data; critically interpret information; and learn how to be a more effective citizen and human engaging in data analysis, management, and policy study. My interest is not in correcting AI slop,14 nor does my interest lie in trying to figure out if you are attempting to pass AI slop15 off as your own work. Accordingly, I will generally just not spend time trying to guess if your assignments are AI generated, nor will I typically engage with technology that purports to do this for me.16"

Second, you might be interested in some further readings and resources on AI, its use, its societal implications, and how we might think about public and private policy surrounding AI. The first place I might point you to is to courses available to you at Maxwell and Syracuse, more broadly: I teach a course in AI Policy, Professor Himmelreich teaches a class on Data Ethics, and Professor Zhang teaches a class on AI Governance and Politics. There are also a broader set of other AI-related things happening at Syracuse, including events through the Autonomous Systems Policy Institute (ASPI), resources organized by ITS, and many more.\nA few other things I’d recommend:\n\nMelanie Mitchell, professor at the Santa Fe Institute and one of the most nuanced thinkers about AI I know, has a series of articles that are well worth reading as well as an excellent podcast she hosted on AI. She also was interviewed in one of my favorite blog post titles ever, “How Your Cheese-Powered Baby Trounces AI”.\nAndrew Heiss, a professor in public management and policy at Georgia State’s Andrew Young School, has a similar digression on AI and education that’s worth looking through, including the sources and footnotes. (You’ll note some resemblance between his and my takes.)\nGary Marcus’ substack is generally very AI-critical, but a good place to keep up on current AI trends and hype. Luiza Jarovsky’s substack is a good place to read about AI governance.\nIf you’re more interested in the business and tech industry sides of AI, Benjamin Evans and Ben Thompson are worth adding to your bookmarks-slash-RSS reader-slash-email inbox-slash-future mechanism for keeping track of internet news that hasn’t yet been invented.\n\nFinally, as I’m always eager to know how far students actually read syllabi: if you at this point, and still reading about AI and my thoughts on it, send me an email with a recommendation for your favorite artificial intelligence related novel, movie, or TV-show. I’ll give you a bonus point on your next test for your perserverance and diligence."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nSo many thoughts, in fact, that I teach a whole class on AI Policy! Come take it with me in the spring if you’re interested.↩︎\nI for instance, used AI tools to help me build this website, and I would guess that I was able to do it at least twice as quickly as I would have been able to without AI.↩︎\nGenerally speaking, at least. If you’re paying attention to some of the details with AI, you know about something called an LRM - or Large Reasoning Model. To a first approximation, they try to introduce better and more complex reasoning into the base prediction process, sometimes going so far to do things like generate python code to do math analysis. These “reasoning” models, however, still often fall short on relatively simple reasoning tasks (see The Illusion of Thinking (2025), published by researchers at Apple).↩︎\nFrankfurt, (2005) On Bullshit; Hicks, Humphries, and Slater, (2024) ChatGPT is Bullshit. For those interested in a full taxonomy, Frankfurt helpfully helps us distinguish between bullshit and any number of additional different not-quite-truthisms, including humbug, hot air, bluff, bravado, and lying.↩︎\nFor another excellent example of profanity being elegantly used to make clear points in academic settings, see Healy, 2107. “Fuck Nuance”, which genuinely contains very good advice on writing. (Although to be fair, you can also get most of the point of that article just from the title . . . which is also the point.)↩︎\nInsert proper “value of doing the tough work” metaphor here: eating your vegetables, walking uphill both ways to school in a snowstorm, learning to program in assembly before C, etc.↩︎\nYou never really know what you’re over the hill, but you feel it coming sooner every day.↩︎\nMany publications, for instance, have explict and clear instructions that prevent you from cheekily listing ChatGPT or Claude as a coauthor, in fact - even if they allow for the use of ChatGPT in the production of the manuscript. See, for instance, this discussion in regards to journals published by Springer-Nature.↩︎\nA good parallel here is Microsoft Office: if you write some nonsensible hot garbage in Word, Microsoft is never going to take responsiblity for any of that business. They’ll (correctly) note that it was just some dumb human that wrote it using their tool.↩︎\nAgain, an academic reference!↩︎\nAnother way to think about it: ChatGPT never writes a paragraph for me, but it does occasionally help me find the right word I’m looking for (like a dictionary) or identify the right way to use particular commands in code.↩︎\nFor the record, my money would be somewhere much more than “fumbling stumble” but not quite “giant leap” - perhaps “large but uncertain step”? Either way, however, I don’t think much is gained from preventing students from using AI. It’s just the next tool in the chain, and it’s not like you see people walking around all day using a slide rule or abacus. Technology marches on in fits and starts regardless.↩︎\nAn all too common mistake made today by students, educators, and administrators alike, for the record.↩︎\nAn arduous, unending, and unenviable task, like Sisyphus with his rock.↩︎\nAI slop: also known as, well, you know.↩︎\nThe technical tools that try to detect LLM writing are imperfect, anyways, resulting in a lot of uncertainty and false positives. Furthermore, experience has taught me that typically, poor used and generated LLM content will often earn poor marks, regardless, and have some pretty clear “tells”. This means I don’t have to care too much if you produce bad work with AI or bad work without AI: it’s just bad work. And your learning, in the final anlaysis, really is up to you. If you want to cut corners and use AI irresponsibly, there’s nothing I can do to stop you. (It’s really just future you that you’re hurting, anyways.) If you want to use LLMs responsibly successfully, well: great! That’s probably the way of the future, anyways, and I hope that this document, along with other elements of my and others classes, help you learn how to do so successfully.↩︎"

    "text": "As a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused research institution, Syracuse University considers academic integrity at the forefront of learning, serving as a core value and guiding pillar of education. Syracuse University’s Academic Integrity Policy provides students with the necessary guidelines to complete academic work with integrity throughout their studies. Students are required to uphold both course-specific and university-wide academic integrity expectations such as crediting your sources, doing your own work, communicating honestly, and supporting academic integrity. The full Syracuse University Academic Integrity Policy can be viewed by visiting the Syracuse University Policies website.\nUpholding Academic Integrity includes the protection of faculty’s intellectual property. Students should not upload, distribute, or share instructors’ course materials, including presentations, assignments, exams, or other evaluative materials without permission. Using websites that charge fees or require uploading of course material (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero) to obtain exam solutions or assignments completed by others, which are then presented as your own violates academic integrity expectations in this course and may be classified as a Level 3 violation. All academic integrity expectations that apply to in-person assignments, quizzes, and exams also apply online.\nStudents found in violation of the policy are subject to grade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions determined by the School or College where the course is offered. Students may not drop or withdraw from courses in which they face a suspected violation. Any established violation in this course may result in course failure regardless of violation level."

This class introduces students to the technical tools necessary to do these tasks in an open and reproducible fashion suitable for modern computational data workflows. Throughout the course of the semester, students will learn the principles and practice of conducting reproducible quantitative research, including readable programming and coding, version control, methods of documentation, data storage, workflow management, and exploratory data visualization. A variety of relevant open technical software tools will be introduced and used, including but not limited to R (and RStudio), git (and github), markdown, LaTeX, and a variety of helper programs to tie things together."

That’s OK!\nThat said, attendance in class is an important element to doing well in the course. If you must miss more than a couple days, it’s a good idea to check in with me so that I don’t mark you off for chronic absenteeism. The easiest way to do this is just email me with a brief reason when something comes up and you have to miss class (which will also allow me to tell you if you’re missing anything particularly important).\nIf you must miss class, the way to make up what you’ve missed is straightforward: make sure to look over the posted slides, do the reading for the day, get notes from a friend, and still complete the assignment if you are able (or, if it is a day we are going over the assignment, make sure to look over the assignment solutions).
