## Due This Week: [Practicum 2](../problemsets/prac2.qmd)

## Lecture: Statistics & Flow Control

## Readings & Reference Material

- Core Reading
    - **DV**, ch 6
    - **FCSP**, ch 4    
- Reference Materials
    - There are a lot of R companion books that focus on statistics.  A few I like:
        - Verzani, *Using R for Introductory Statisics*.  A basic statistics with R text.
        - Gelman, Hill, and Vehari, *Regression and Other Stories*.  An excellent introduction to regression generally, with applications in R.
        - Imai, *Quantitative Social Science*.  A textbook for a course that is a blend of statistics and R wrangling.
