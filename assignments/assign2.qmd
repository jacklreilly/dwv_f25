## Readings

- Recommended reference reading:
  - **DV**, chapter 1
  - **RDS** chapter 2
  - **FCSP** chapters 1-2
    - *We will not cover all of this material in ch 2 this week; don't get too caught up on things not in course slides or course R scripts*
  - **DMSS** chapters 1-2
    - *Ignore, for now, things that relate to Database Management Systems (DBSMs) or SQL*
  - **The Plain Person's Guide to Plain Text Social Science**, ch 1-2 (<https://plain-text.co/index.html>)
    - *Note: The Plain Person's Guide is a little out of date techinically - some of the tools discussed have newer, and better, versions - but the overlying principles and philosophy are what you should pay attention to*
