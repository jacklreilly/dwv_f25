## Data & Computational Work

The main purpose of this week's assignment is to get your computer ready for all the work in the class.  This means, primarily, installing software.

### Install R on your computer

Begin by installing R (<http://cloud.r-project.org>). Choose the version appropriate for your computing platform:

- If you use macOS with an Apple Silicon processor (i.e. an M-series processor), then install [R for macOS's Apple Silicon build](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.5.1-arm64.pkg). This version does not work on older, Intel-based Macs.

- If you use macOS with an Intel processor, then install [R for macOS's Intel build](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/base/R-4.5.1-x86_64.pkg).

- If you use Microsoft Windows, then install [R for Windows](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.5.1-win.exe).

- If you use Linux, [choose your distribution](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/) and install the R package for it.

### Install RStudio on your computer

- If you use macOS (whether Apple Silicon or Intel), [install this version of RStudio](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/macos/RStudio-2025.05.1-513.dmg).

- If you use Windows, [install this version of RStudio](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2025.05.1-513.exe).

- If you use Linux, [choose your distribution from the download page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

### Confirm things work

- R is really a great big calculator.  Let's do some calculations!
   - Add 2 and 3 together
 	- Multiply 4 by 6
 	- Divide 10 by 5
