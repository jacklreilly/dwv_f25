## Computer Work

If you do not have one already, create a GitHub account and obtain a GitHub Personal Access Token. 

1. Register a [GitHub Account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html).
2. (Optional) Install [Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git).  *Note: this step is only optional if you use the GitHub Desktop Client; if you use any other client, you must install Git at the command line.*
3. Install a [Git Client](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html).  I strongly recommend you use the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://github.com/apps/desktop), which comes with git built-in, so that you do not have to install git separately (and can thus skip step 2).
4. Get a [Personal Access Token](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat).
5. Connect to [GitHub and start an initial repo.](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html).
