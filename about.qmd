## Technical Details

The site was built in [Quarto](https://quarto.org) in [Postitron](https://positron.posit.co), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). Course content (obviously) makes heavy use of [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Slides are built with Apple Keynote and exported to PDFs.
