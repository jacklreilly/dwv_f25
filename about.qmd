## Technical Details

The site was built in [Quarto](https://quarto.org) in [Postitron](https://positron.posit.co), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). Course content (obviously) makes heavy use of [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Slides are built with Apple Keynote and exported to PDFs.

## Credits and Acknowledgements

This course page was inspired, in spirit if not in all technical details, by related courses from [Andrew Heiss](https://datavizf25.classes.andrewheiss.com) and [Kieran Healy](https://mptc.io). Other acknowledgements for particular content can be found in content pages and course slides.
