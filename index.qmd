Hello and welcome to the course website for PAI 400/600, "Data Wrangling and Visualization." I am your instructor, [Professor Jack Reilly](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/jack-reilly).  You can find more about me on my [website](https://jacklreilly.github.io), but in short: 

- Data analysis and statistics is honestly one of my favorite things to teach. I've been teaching them for over 15 years now, at [multiple](https://www.ucdavis.edu) [different](https://www.ncf.edu) [institutions](https://www.syracuse.edu/), and I'm very much looking forward to doing so again this semester with you all.  

- I also research and write papers on [American politics and quantitative methods](https://jacklreilly.github.io/research) and was born and raised right here in beautiful [Upstate New York](https://discoverupstateny.com).

Please take a minute to browse this website, where you'll find the course [overview](overview.qmd), topic [schedule](schedule.qmd), course [content](assignments/index.qmd), class and university academic [policies](policies.qmd), and [more](ai.qmd).
